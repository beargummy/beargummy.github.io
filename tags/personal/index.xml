      <description>The story begins in my schooldays back in late 90s. I was very lucky to get informatics class at my 5th grade. This was pretty unusual for my school, all others got their first informatics class only starting from 9th grade. I&amp;rsquo;ve been taught Pascal and a bit of C. My teacher were married to a professional programmer, so she tried to develop really good programming class that involved solving both olimpic programming tasks and more real life, or fun projects.</description>

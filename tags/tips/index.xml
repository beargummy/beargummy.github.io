      <description>Recently I had to start using windows for development, and since I was wanna keep using my beloved MacBook, which I used for many years, I had to choose which option will work for me best. There were 3 options to choose from:
 Use windows workstation via RDP. This may sound costly, but I have a windows machine to spare. Create a Windows VM via Parallels (as this is still the best way to run Windows on Mac).</description>
